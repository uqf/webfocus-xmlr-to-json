# WebFocus XMLR to JSON
This repository provides an example of how to generate useful JSON output of WebFocus reports by transforming the XMLR output format with a simple XSL transform. This is particularly useful for making the data from existing WebFocus reports available in a form that can be parsed or processed by an external system.

## How to Run
`php -f run.php > ./examples/car/output.json`
